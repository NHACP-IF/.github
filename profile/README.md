# Welcome to the NHACP Implementers Forum!

The NHACP Implementers Forum is *the* place for accessing resources
related to the NABU HCCA Application Communication Protocol.

NHACP was born out of a desire for an open protocol specification for
building connected programs for the NABU Personal Computer that would
work with any NABU network adapter implementation.  Interest in NHACP
has grown beyond the NABU community to other retro-computing projects,
and this forum exists to coordinate efforts among implementors of NHACP
servers and clients to define new NHACP protocol features and ensure
compatibility.

## The NHACP specification

The NHACP specification can be found [here](https://github.com/NHACP-IF/NHACP-specification).

## Known NHACP server implementations

* @retrotechchris's [JavaNabuAdapter](https://github.com/cml37/JavaNabuAdapter),
  written in Java.
* Nick Daniels' [NABU NetSim](https://github.com/GryBsh/NabuNetworkEmulator),
  written in C#.
* [NabuNetwork.com Internet Adaptor](https://github.com/nabunetwork/Adaptor),
  written in C#.
* Hans Hübner's [ovomorph](https://github.com/hanshuebner/ovomorph), written
  in Lisp.
* @thorpej's [nabud](https://github.com/thorpej/nabud), written in C.
* Christopher Masto's [nabu.run](https://github.com/masto/nabu.run), written
  in JavaScript and run from your browser! Try it out [here](https://nabu.run)!

## Known NHACP client implementations

* Hans Hübner's [NABU fig-FORTH](https://github.com/hanshuebner/nabu-figforth).
* tergav17's [Ishkur CP/M](https://github.com/tergav17/IshkurCPM), which
  supports using NHACP for virtual disk access *and* native file system
  access.
* @thorpej's [nabud](https://github.com/thorpej/nabud) includes a
  *nabuclient* test program that implements a simple NHACP client
  for the purpose of testing the *nabud* server.
