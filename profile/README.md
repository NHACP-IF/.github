# Welcome to the NHACP Implementers Forum!

The NHACP Implementers Forum is *the* place for accessing resources
related to the NABU HCCA Application Communication Protocol.

NHACP was born out of a desire for an open protocol specification for
building connected programs for the NABU Personal Computer that would
work with any NABU network adapter implementation.  Interest in NHACP
has grown beyond the NABU community to other retro-computing projects,
and this forum exists to coordinate efforts among implementors of NHACP
servers and clients to define new NHACP protocol features and ensure
compatibility.

## The NHACP specification

The NHACP specification can be found [here](https://github.com/NHACP-IF/NHACP-specification).
